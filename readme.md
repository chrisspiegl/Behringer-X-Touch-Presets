# [Behringer X-Touch Mini](https://crsp.li/xtouchmini) Button Layer A/B Presets

These files can be loaded with the [Behringer X-Touch Editor](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0B3M). Sadly this editor is only available on Windows and not for macOS and the only known workaround is to use a virtual machine via [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

## Purpose

By default the [X-Touch Mini](https://crsp.li/xtouchmini) is not setup very "logical" with it's notes, dials, and faders. The notes and buttons are are rather random in their numbering.

With these presets the numbering is much more logical and easy to remember.

## Button & Dial Layout Logic

Twisting the twist dials will send **CONTROL CHANGE** with values from **0** to **127**.

Pressing the twist dials will send **NOTE_ON** with value **127** on press and **NOTE_OFF** with value **0** on release.

All buttons are sending **NOTE_ON** with value **127** on press and **NOTE_OFF** with value **0** on release.

The Fader sends **CONTROL CHANGE** with values between **0** and **127**.
